        <pre>
            Nobody knows, just why we're here
            Could it be fate or random circumstance
            At the right place, at the right time
            Two roads intertwine
            And if the universe conspired
            To meld our lives, to make us, fuel and fire
            Then know wherever you will be
            So too, shall I'll be

            Close your eyes, dry your tears
            'Cause when nothing seems clear
            You'll be safe here from the sheer weight
            Of your doubts and fears
            Weary heart, you'll be safe here
            
            Remember how we laughed until we cried
            At the most stupid things like
            We were so high
            But love was all that we were on, we belong
            And though the world would never understand
            This unlikely union and why it still stands
            Someday, we will be set free
            Pray and believe
            
            When the light disappears
            And when this world's insincere
            You'll be safe here
            When nobody hears you scream
            I'll scream with you
            You'll be safe here (Ooh ooh, Ahh hah ahh)
            
            Save your eyes from your tears
            When everything's unclear
            You'll be safe here from the sheer weight
            Of your doubts and fears wounded heart
            
            When the light disappears
            And when this world's insincere
            You'll be safe here
            When nobody hears you scream
            I'll scream with you you'll be safe here
            
            In my arms through the long cold night
            Sleep tight, you'll be safe here
            When no one understands
            I'll believe, you'll be safe
            You'll be safe, you'll be safe here, ooh ooh
            
            Put your heart in my hands
            You'll be safe here
